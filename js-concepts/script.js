// JavaScript Datatypes

// Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Object

// Const Let Var

// Const variable cannot be changed or updated, Let variable can be changed or updated, defined locally, var can be changed or updated and defined globally scoped

// Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference

// Pass by value is changing the variable to another variable while pass by reference is calling the parameter of a function that's been defined

// Map, Filter and Reduce

// Map takes in a callback that runs for each value in the array and returns each new value in the resulting array, map does not mutate array but callbackfn can

// Filter takes in a callback function that returns true, it will be in resulting array, if returns false then it wouldn't

// Reduce takes in an accumulator that is the end result and takes in a reducer that is the value used to change the accumulator and runs it through the expression, does not mutate array
