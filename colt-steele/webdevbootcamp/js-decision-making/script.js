// Boolean Logic, Making decisions with JavaScript
// Comparisons
/*
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
== equality
!= not equal
=== strict equality
!== strict non-equality
*/

// Examples
/*
10 > 1 true
0.2 > 0.3 false
-10 < 0 true
50.5 < 5 false
0.5 <= 0.5 true
99 >= 4 true
99 >= 99 true
'a' < 'b' true
'A' > 'a' false

Notice these all return a Boolean!

Though it's uncommon, you can compare strings. Just be careful, things get dicey when dealing with case, special characters, and accents!
